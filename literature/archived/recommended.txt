After the initial meeting, it became very clear to me that the pre-proposal is very inadequate. 
The professor expected something more, and even something closer to 0DTE's.

1. An assessment of how predictable ultra short-term IVs are, applying different machine learning methods (in the spirit of Gu, Kelly and Xiu, 2020) using a large
set of covariates. The relative importance of different covariates can be analyzed.
Investigating how predictability patterns compare to IVs of longer horizons would
be interesting. Exploiting predictive information to construct profitable trading
strategies would be another possibility.

2. Arguably, the latent factors driving ultra short-term IVs are different from those
driving the more well-studied long-horizon IVs. Modeling the factor structure of
the options across maturities using Principal Component Analysis techniques or
parametric factor models (Goncalves and Guidolin, 2006; Fran¸cois et al., 2022)
would be an interesting venue to pursue. A nonlinear alternative, in the spirit of
Gu, Kelly and Xiu (2021), would be to use Autoencoders

3. Options contain forward-looking information about investors’ expectations of future
market conditions. Therefore, ultra short-term IVs could be useful in predicting
excess market returns or realized volatilities over daily horizons. Extracting this
information using machine learning and comparing to popular prediction methods
in the literature would be interesting.
