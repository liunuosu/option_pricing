Abstract
We uncover new return predictability in the cross-section of delta-hedged 
equity options. Expected returns to writing delta-hedged calls are negatively 
correlated with stock price, profit margin, and firm profitability, but positively 
correlated with cash holding, cash flow variance, new shares issuance, 
total external financing, distress risk, and dispersion of analysts’ forecasts. 
Our option portfolio strategies have annual Sharpe ratio above two and remain 
profitable after transaction costs. Their profits can be explained by two 
option factors, while equity risk factors have no explanatory power. 
We find support for several economic channels at work, 
yet the option return predictability remains puzzling.
