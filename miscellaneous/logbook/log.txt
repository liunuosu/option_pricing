Title: 	Kick-off meeting	12-03-2024 11:05

Dear Student,

This mail informs you about the kick-off meeting, in which we will discuss your thesis proposal and research plan.

To prepare for the meeting, please write a first draft of the proposal that includes the following aspects that have already been mentioned in the thesis guideline documents.

1. Definition of the problem/question. What constitutes the problem? Which aspects are important?
2. Relevance: Why and for whom is the research interesting and relevant? Is it purely of scientific relevance, or is it also of interest for practical applications?
3. Literature: What results have been obtained in previous research on this topic? How does the study relate to the existing literature?
4. Motivation: Why is the research necessary? Why is the existing knowledge on this topic insufficient? How will the research address these issues?
5. Methods: Which (econometric) methods and techniques will be applied in your research? Why are the ways appropriate here?
6. Data: What kind of data are needed and available for the research?
7. Timeframe.

In addition, I recommend the following: (i) identify the most straightforward model you based your research on - this usually implies finding the seminal paper relevant to the topic and making sure you understand the theoretical model; (ii) identify a maximum of five papers highly cited that build on the seminal paper and make a summary of them; after reading them, you should have a list of top 10 research questions that you might want to pursue; (iii) relate the research question with data that you want to use and check its availability. You can incorporate these into the proposal or include them in a separate document.

Once you have done this, please send me the draft so I can schedule the kick-off meeting.

Best wishes,
Maria Grith
