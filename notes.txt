In the same spirit, we ask in this paper whether it is possible to use the information contained
in implied volatility data to conduct inference about an underlying stochastic volatility (rather than
a local volatility) model. At each point in time, implied volatility data take the form of a surface
representing the implied volatility of the option as a function of its moneyness and time to maturity.
We will show that it is possible to use a small number of observable and practically useful “shape
characteristics” of the implied volatility surface, including but not limited to the slope of the implied
volatility smile, to fully characterize the underlying stochastic volatility model.


Difference from kelly, gu and xiu, is that they use a large set of covariates. This may not be applicable in our case,
since we have ultra short term 0DTE options.. It will be difficult here, I suspect.

What machine learning models do I want to use? We have 
1. Ensemble Methods
2. Penalized regressions
3. Neural Network representations
4. Support Vector Machines
5.
