In the same spirit, we ask in this paper whether it is possible to use the information contained
in implied volatility data to conduct inference about an underlying stochastic volatility (rather than
a local volatility) model. At each point in time, implied volatility data take the form of a surface
representing the implied volatility of the option as a function of its moneyness and time to maturity.
We will show that it is possible to use a small number of observable and practically useful “shape
characteristics” of the implied volatility surface, including but not limited to the slope of the implied
volatility smile, to fully characterize the underlying stochastic volatility model.


Difference from kelly, gu and xiu, is that they use a large set of covariates. This may not be applicable in our case,
since we have ultra short term 0DTE options.. It will be difficult here, I suspect.

2. Features of the IV Surface
1. Volatility Smile/Smirk/Skew
Volatility Smile: A smile occurs when IV is higher for both deep in-the-money (ITM) and deep out-of-the-money (OTM) options, with lower IV for at-the-money (ATM) options.

Why it Happens: Deep ITM and OTM options are often more expensive because they imply higher risk for large price movements (i.e., investors are willing to pay more for protection against extreme scenarios).
Interpretation: A smile indicates that investors are pricing in tail risks or extreme moves in the underlying asset's price.
Volatility Skew or Smirk: Skew refers to an asymmetric IV surface, where OTM puts have significantly higher IV than OTM calls.

Why it Happens: In equities, investors tend to buy puts to hedge downside risk, which inflates put option IV.
Interpretation: A skewed surface indicates a market bias. A steep downside skew (high IV for puts) suggests fear of downside risk (e.g., market crashes). A flatter skew or upward skew (higher call IV) can indicate strong upward expectations.
2. Term Structure of Implied Volatility
Shape: The IV term structure shows how IV changes across different maturities.
Normal Market: IV tends to be lower for short-term options and higher for long-term options, forming a gentle upward slope.
Why?: Short-term uncertainty is lower, but long-term risks (such as economic shifts, interest rate changes) push IV higher.
In Times of Crisis: Short-term IV may spike (creating a steep curve) due to immediate risks like earnings announcements, geopolitical events, etc.
Interpretation: A steep upward slope indicates growing uncertainty or risk as time progresses. A flat or inverted term structure (higher IV for short-term options) signals near-term risk, often due to events like earnings or central bank announcements.

OTHER COVARIATES???
1. Market Covariates
1.1 Underlying Asset Price
Why it’s used: Changes in the price of the underlying asset (e.g., stock, index, or commodity) directly affect option prices and, by extension, the implied volatility surface.
Effect: A sharp drop in the underlying asset’s price often increases the demand for puts (leading to higher IV for puts), while large price increases can elevate call IV.
1.2 Realized (Historical) Volatility
Why it’s used: Realized volatility (the actual past volatility of the asset) is often a good indicator of future volatility expectations. Market participants adjust their expectations based on the asset’s recent price fluctuations.
Effect: If recent realized volatility is high, implied volatility tends to increase as the market anticipates future volatility.
1.3 Stock Market Indices (e.g., S&P 500, VIX)
Why it’s used: Implied volatility is often correlated with broader market indices and sentiment measures like the VIX (Volatility Index).
Effect: A rise in the VIX, which is often referred to as the "fear gauge," indicates higher market-wide uncertainty, which can increase the IV across the board. Stock market declines also typically cause implied volatility to spike.
1.4 Trading Volume and Liquidity
Why it’s used: High trading volume and market liquidity are associated with greater price movements and increased uncertainty, affecting option prices and the IV surface.
Effect: Increased trading volume can signal more aggressive positioning by market participants, leading to higher volatility expectations.
1.5 Interest Rates and Bond Yields
Why it’s used: Interest rates, particularly the risk-free rate (e.g., Treasury yields), affect option prices and, consequently, IV. The cost of carry for options includes interest rate considerations.
Effect: Rising interest rates generally lead to higher call option prices (and sometimes lower put option prices), which can impact the skew of the IV surface.
2. Option-Specific Covariates
2.1 Moneyness (Strike Price / Spot Price)
Why it’s used: Moneyness, or the relationship between the strike price and the current spot price of the asset, is a key driver of implied volatility. It affects whether an option is at-the-money (ATM), in-the-money (ITM), or out-of-the-money (OTM).
Effect: OTM options tend to have higher implied volatility, especially in risk-averse markets, which creates the characteristic "volatility smile" or "skew" on the surface.
2.2 Time to Maturity (Tenor)
Why it’s used: The time left until an option expires affects its sensitivity to volatility (known as "Vega"). Short-term options react more strongly to immediate volatility, while long-term options are more influenced by long-term risks.
Effect: Options with very short times to maturity typically exhibit higher IV due to time decay and the greater impact of short-term volatility expectations. Long-term options reflect longer-term uncertainty.
2.3 Option Delta
Why it’s used: Delta measures how much the option’s price moves relative to the underlying asset. It’s used to account for sensitivity to directional price movements and changes in moneyness.
Effect: Options with different deltas (e.g., deep in-the-money or far out-of-the-money) display different volatilities. Analyzing delta helps capture the curvature of the IV surface.
2.4 Open Interest
Why it’s used: Open interest measures the total number of outstanding option contracts in the market. High open interest can indicate significant positioning and thus heightened expectations of future volatility.
Effect: Large open interest, especially in certain strikes or expiries, can lead to higher IV due to supply and demand imbalances for those options.
3. Macroeconomic Covariates
3.1 Economic Announcements (e.g., GDP, Inflation Data, Interest Rate Decisions)
Why it’s used: Economic data releases can cause sudden shifts in market sentiment and volatility. Implied volatility often spikes in anticipation of major macroeconomic news, and the IV surface tends to steepen.
Effect: Before important announcements (like Fed rate decisions), short-term IV often rises, leading to an inverted or upward-sloping IV term structure.
3.2 Corporate Earnings Announcements
Why it’s used: Implied volatility tends to increase in the days leading up to earnings announcements, especially for individual stocks. The IV surface steepens, particularly for near-term options.
Effect: After earnings, volatility typically drops sharply (this is called volatility crush), but IV can remain elevated if there’s post-earnings uncertainty.
3.3 Geopolitical Events
Why it’s used: Major geopolitical risks, like wars, elections, or trade disputes, can increase implied volatility across the market.
Effect: These events tend to increase short-term IV sharply while also steepening the skew, reflecting higher demand for downside protection.
4. Technical Indicators and Sentiment Covariates
4.1 Momentum Indicators (e.g., Relative Strength Index (RSI))
Why it’s used: Technical momentum indicators like the RSI provide insights into whether the market is overbought or oversold, which can affect volatility expectations.
Effect: In overbought markets, IV may rise as traders anticipate a reversal. In oversold conditions, IV may also increase due to panic selling or a perceived rise in risk.
4.2 Implied Volatility of Related Assets (Cross-Asset Volatility)
Why it’s used: Implied volatility from related markets (e.g., other assets in the same sector or similar products) can influence the IV surface of an asset.
Effect: For instance, volatility in the oil market may influence implied volatility for oil-related stocks. A spike in one market can transmit to another.
4.3 Sentiment Indicators (e.g., Put-Call Ratio)
Why it’s used: The Put-Call Ratio measures the relative trading volume of puts to calls. High values indicate bearish sentiment, while low values indicate bullish sentiment.
Effect: When the put-call ratio rises, it signals increased hedging activity, often causing the implied volatility for puts to rise.
4.4 News Sentiment
Why it’s used: Sentiment analysis of news, social media, and other sources can provide leading indicators of market expectations.
Effect: Sudden negative news can cause short-term spikes in implied volatility, particularly for individual stocks or industries.
5. Stochastic and Model-Based Covariates
5.1 Stochastic Volatility Models (e.g., Heston Model)
Why it’s used: Stochastic models are used to predict how volatility evolves over time. Parameters like the volatility of volatility, mean reversion rates, and jumps are common covariates for IVS prediction.
Effect: These models capture complex dynamics in the IV surface, including how volatility changes across different time horizons and strikes.
5.2 Jumps in Asset Prices (Jump Diffusion Models)
Why it’s used: Some models (e.g., Merton’s jump diffusion model) incorporate the probability of sudden price jumps, which can drastically impact implied volatility.
Effect: Options markets price in the potential for jumps, causing increased IV for OTM options or near-term contracts.
5.3 Risk-Neutral Moments
Why it’s used: Higher-order moments, such as skewness (third moment) and kurtosis (fourth moment), can provide additional information about the distribution of future returns.
Effect: Higher skewness or kurtosis can steepen the volatility smile, as the market prices in a higher probability of extreme moves.
6. Microstructure Covariates
6.1 Bid-Ask Spread
Why it’s used: The bid-ask spread reflects liquidity and transaction costs in the options market. Wider spreads indicate lower liquidity, which can cause IV to rise.
Effect: Analyzing changes in the bid-ask spread can provide clues about market stress or changing supply-demand dynamics in the options market.
6.2 Order Flow
Why it’s used: Order flow (i.e., the volume and direction of buy and sell orders) can affect the IV surface, especially when there are large, concentrated trades.
Effect: A high concentration of sell orders (e.g., in puts) can cause the skew to steepen, reflecting increased demand for downside protection.
