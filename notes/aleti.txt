A paper about news and the efect on the stochastic discount factor of intraday returns:
We find that news
related to monetary policy and finance typically accounts for the largest portion
of the variation in the SDF and the tangency portfolio risk premium, followed by news
about international affairs and macroeconomic data. 
We find that different news topics tend to affect different fundamental economic shocks
perhaps surprisngly, we find that a large fraction of the monetary policy news that is
priced is not covered by the tradtional monetary policy calendars
