After completing the proposal, a few questions have popped up (add own answer to it later)
1. After the data cleaning, where every observations with null implied volatility is
removed, all 0DTE options that was in the dataset was omitted. It seems like optionmetrics
is unable to calculate this implied volatility, but the trading volume for some 
0DTE observations is not 0. I am not sure if we can somehow obtain this implied volatility,
as the data from option metrics is end-of-day, and not intra-day. I think the omitting
the 0DTE is unavoidable

2. The value of the IV depends on the method one uses to extract it. OptionMetrics 
applies an inversion of the Black-Scholes formula, can one assume that this IV is
the 'correct' implied volatility? Papers in literature have skimmed over this part,
and try to predict the IVs given by the data vendor. 

3. There is an observation inbalance in the years of the dataset. The starting years 
contain little observations, while the latter years are the most complete (contains
all maturities considered). I don't think a smoother can solve this for the early 
years, as some days only contain observations for a single maturity. My take is to
omit the observations in the early years, is that reasonable?

4. The papers I found in the literature lack a statistical test. To compare forecasts,
the IVRSME or R-squared is taken, and the values between models are directly compared
to each other. I found this peculiar, and was thinking whether we can apply a 
statistical test here. I was wondering if a Diebold-Mariano test can be used in this 
context?
